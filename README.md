# eGuarda
## Description
eGuarda is a web service used for increasing public safety. Users will be able to post a report about a (possible) criminal event that they witnessed or suspicious groups that they saw. Reports will be projected on a map, where users will be able to see which areas are more likely to be dangerous, which can prove to be useful for people that don't know their surroundings (E.g. travellers).
